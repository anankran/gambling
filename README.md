# Gambling

Some considerations:
1. I used Laravel in this project because it was indicated. In general, in a small project like this I would go for a micro-framework.
2. I only tested the 2 function that are the core of the feature. Next step would be some feature tests.
3. In general I prefer to run my services on containers. But as in this case there's not database use, I put that aside.
